# Web Auditor (Playwright)

Web Auditor is an open-source website auditing tool designed to analyze and improve the quality of informational websites.

Built on top of Playwright, it crawls websites and runs a series of customizable plugins to detect issues across multiple domains such as accessibility, SEO, performance, and best practices.

## Features

- Website crawling with configurable depth and scope
- Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- Accessibility audits (axe, etc.)
- SEO checks (titles, meta tags, structure)
- Performance insights (Lighthouse-like audits)
- Security checks (SSL, headers, certificates)
- Media analysis (images size, metadata, etc.)
- Resource analysis (PDF, downloads, MIME types)
- Structured JSON reports (one per URL)

## Plugin System

Web Auditor is built around a flexible plugin system. Each plugin can:

- Analyze pages or resources
- Emit findings categorized (SEO, A11y, Security, etc.)
- Be enabled/disabled via configuration

## Configuration

The tool can be configured using [environment variables](#environment-variables):

- URL allowlists / blocklists (regex)
- Plugin activation control
- Output directory
- Crawl limits

## Use Cases

- Audit institutional or public service websites
- Continuous quality monitoring
- Pre-production validation
- Technical SEO and accessibility reviews

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript / Node.js
- Playwright
- Optional integrations: axe-core, pa11y, trextract

## Roadmap

- Enhanced reporting (aggregated dashboards)
- CI/CD integration
- Scheduling and automation
- Web server to follow the audit and its report
- Lighthouse plugin every x pages
- Generate a HTML report with
    - Reports summary
    - European compatible accessibility report in french, dutch, german and english
- Generate a sitemap.xml report
- Validate sitemap resources
- Validate robots.txt
    - Ensure that the robots.txt has a rule to throttle the robots
    - Ensure that all page's CSS are not blocked by robots.txt's rules
- Images metadata plugin
- Images integration in HTML pages plugin
    - Non optimized images
    - Lazy loading
- Empty anchor links
- Log link's targets
- Logs external dependencies
- Cookie plugin
    - lifetime
- Stats by locales
- Tests runner's IPs like https://ipv4.icanhazip.com/ and https://ipv6.icanhazip.com/
- hreflang
- Soft 404
- Analyse text's complexity (something like [Scolarius](https://www.scolarius.com/))
- JSON-LD structure
    - `@context": "https://schema.org"`

## Installing Playwright and launch an audit locally

To use Web Auditor locally, you first need to install Playwright and its required browsers. After cloning the repository, install the project dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, install Playwright along with the supported browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

This command downloads the necessary browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit). If you are running the project in a restricted environment (e.g., corporate network or Docker), make sure all required system dependencies are available. For Linux environments, you may need to run:

```shell
npx playwright install-deps
```

Once completed, Playwright is ready to use and the Web Auditor can start crawling and auditing websites.

```shell
START_URL=htttps://your-site.com RATE_LIMIT_MS=400 WEBSITE_ID=your_site npm start
```

Press `s` to gracefully stop the audit and generate the report.

## Build & run a docker image locally

```shell
docker build -t elasticms/web-auditor .

docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/reports:/opt/reports \
  -e START_URL="https://your-site.com" \
  -e WEBSITE_ID="your_site" \
  -e MAX_PAGES="80" \
  -e MAX_DEPTH="15" \
  -e CONCURRENCY="2" \
  -e RATE_LIMIT_MS="500" \
  -e CHECK_EXTERNAL_LINKS="false" \
  elasticms/web-auditor
```

## Environment Variables

The crawler can be configured using environment variables.  
These variables control crawl behavior, performance limits, and execution parameters.

You can define them directly in the shell, in a `.env` file, or via Docker environment variables.

Example:

```bash
START_URL=https://your-site.com \
MAX_PAGES=100 \
CONCURRENCY=3 \
RATE_LIMIT_MS=500 \
npm start
```

## Performance Tuning

These parameters are the most important for controlling crawler performance:

### Concurrency

`CONCURRENCY` controls how many pages are processed simultaneously.

Typical values:

| Value | Use Case                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`   | Debugging                                            |
| `2-3` | Safe crawling                                        |
| `5`   | Faster crawl                                         |
| `10+` | High-performance crawling (requires strong hardware) |

### Rate Limiting

`RATE_LIMIT_MS` defines the minimum delay between navigation requests.

Examples:

| Value  | Behavior          |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| `0`    | No rate limiting  |
| `200`  | Fast crawl        |
| `500`  | Balanced          |
| `1000` | Very polite crawl |

### HTML Accessibility

Lowercase finding codes (e.g. `area-alt` or `scrollable-region-focusable`) correspond to accessibility rules detected by the a11y-axe plugin.
These codes match Axe’s Rule IDs (as defined by Deque Systems) and indicate specific accessibility issues identified during the audit.
Each rule represents a known accessibility requirement based on standards such as WCAG.
You can find detailed explanations, examples, and remediation guidance for each rule on the [official Axe documentation website](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11).

## Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses **Prettier** for automatic code formatting and **ESLint** for static code analysis.  
Together, they ensure a consistent code style and help detect potential issues early during development.

- **Prettier** → handles formatting (indentation, quotes, line length, etc.)
- **ESLint** → enforces coding best practices and detects problematic patterns

Both tools are configured to work together without conflicts.

### TL;DR

```shell
npm run format && npm run lint:fix && npm run build
```

### Format the Entire Project

To format all files:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Check Formatting

To verify that files follow the formatting rules (useful in CI pipelines):

```bash
npm run format:check
```

If formatting issues are found, run npm run format to automatically fix them.

### Run the Linter

To analyze the project:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Automatically Fix Issues

Some issues can be fixed automatically:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
