# Web-Auditor (with Playwright)

## TL;DR

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Build & run

```shell
docker build -t elasticms/web-auditor .

docker run --rm \
  -e START_URL="https://your-site.com" \

  elasticms/web-auditor
```

## Environment Variables

The crawler can be configured using environment variables.  
These variables control crawl behavior, performance limits, and execution parameters.

You can define them directly in the shell, in a `.env` file, or via Docker environment variables.

Example:
```bash
START_URL=https://your-site.com \
MAX_PAGES=100 \
CONCURRENCY=3 \
RATE_LIMIT_MS=500 \
npm start
```

| Variable               | Default               | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `START_URL`            | `https://example.org` | The initial URL where the crawler starts. All discovered pages will be crawled starting from this entry point.              |
| `MAX_PAGES`            | `50`                  | Maximum number of pages the crawler will visit before stopping.                                                             |
| `MAX_DEPTH`            | `3`                   | Maximum crawl depth starting from the `START_URL`. Depth `0` is the start page.                                             |
| `CONCURRENCY`          | `3`                   | Maximum number of pages processed in parallel. Increasing this value speeds up crawling but increases CPU and memory usage. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MS`        | `500`                 | Minimum delay (in milliseconds) between navigation requests. This helps avoid overloading the target server.                |
| `NAV_TIMEOUT_MS`       | `30000`               | Maximum time (in milliseconds) allowed for page navigation before it is considered a failure.                               |
| `SAME_ORIGIN_ONLY`     | `true`                | If enabled, the crawler only follows links that belong to the same origin as the `START_URL`.                               |
| `CHECK_EXTERNAL_LINKS` | `false`               | If enabled, dead link detection will also test external links. Otherwise only internal links are checked.                   |
| `LH_EVERY_N`           | `10`                  | Run a Lighthouse audit every N HTML pages visited.                                                                          |

## Performance Tuning

These parameters are the most important for controlling crawler performance:

### Concurrency

`CONCURRENCY` controls how many pages are processed simultaneously.

Typical values:

| Value | Use Case                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`   | Debugging                                            |
| `2-3` | Safe crawling                                        |
| `5`   | Faster crawl                                         |
| `10+` | High-performance crawling (requires strong hardware) |

### Rate Limiting

`RATE_LIMIT_MS` defines the minimum delay between navigation requests.

Examples:

| Value  | Behavior          |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| `0`    | No rate limiting  |
| `200`  | Fast crawl        |
| `500`  | Balanced          |
| `1000` | Very polite crawl |

## Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses **Prettier** for automatic code formatting and **ESLint** for static code analysis.  
Together, they ensure a consistent code style and help detect potential issues early during development.

- **Prettier** → handles formatting (indentation, quotes, line length, etc.)
- **ESLint** → enforces coding best practices and detects problematic patterns

Both tools are configured to work together without conflicts.

### Format the Entire Project

To format all files:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Check Formatting

To verify that files follow the formatting rules (useful in CI pipelines):

```bash
npm run format:check
```

If formatting issues are found, run npm run format to automatically fix them.

### Run the Linter

To analyze the project:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Automatically Fix Issues

Some issues can be fixed automatically:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
