# Web-Auditor (with Playwright)

## TL;DR

```shell
npm install
npm run build
START_URL=your-site.com RATE_LIMIT_MS=400 WEBSITE_ID=your_site npm start
```

## Build & run

```shell
docker build -t elasticms/web-auditor .

docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/reports:/opt/reports \
  -e START_URL="https://your-site.com" \
  -e WEBSITE_ID="your_site" \
  -e MAX_PAGES="80" \

## Environment Variables

The crawler can be configured using environment variables.  
These variables control crawl behavior, performance limits, and execution parameters.

You can define them directly in the shell, in a `.env` file, or via Docker environment variables.

Example:

```bash
START_URL=https://your-site.com \
MAX_PAGES=100 \
CONCURRENCY=3 \
RATE_LIMIT_MS=500 \
npm start
```

## Performance Tuning

These parameters are the most important for controlling crawler performance:

### Concurrency

`CONCURRENCY` controls how many pages are processed simultaneously.

Typical values:

| Value | Use Case                                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`   | Debugging                                            |
| `2-3` | Safe crawling                                        |
| `5`   | Faster crawl                                         |
| `10+` | High-performance crawling (requires strong hardware) |

### Rate Limiting

`RATE_LIMIT_MS` defines the minimum delay between navigation requests.

Examples:

| Value  | Behavior          |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| `0`    | No rate limiting  |
| `200`  | Fast crawl        |
| `500`  | Balanced          |
| `1000` | Very polite crawl |

## Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses **Prettier** for automatic code formatting and **ESLint** for static code analysis.  
Together, they ensure a consistent code style and help detect potential issues early during development.

- **Prettier** → handles formatting (indentation, quotes, line length, etc.)
- **ESLint** → enforces coding best practices and detects problematic patterns

Both tools are configured to work together without conflicts.

### Format the Entire Project

To format all files:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Check Formatting

To verify that files follow the formatting rules (useful in CI pipelines):

```bash
npm run format:check
```

If formatting issues are found, run npm run format to automatically fix them.

### Run the Linter

To analyze the project:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Automatically Fix Issues

Some issues can be fixed automatically:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
